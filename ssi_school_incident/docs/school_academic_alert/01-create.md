## Flow

1. Open the **School > Incident > Academic Alerts** menu.

     performed for a different date.
   - **Student**: Select the student whose academic standing is being evaluated.
   - **Grade Class**: Automatically filled from **Student** (the student's homeroom
     class). Change if needed.
4. Optionally fill in the other fields available in Draft status:
   - **Subject Note**: Enter free-text context, e.g. which subject(s) are below the
     passing grade.
   - **Evaluation Context**: Enter optional Python source (plain assignments only, e.g.
     `trigger_count = 3`) used to seed extra local variables before the Academic Alert
     Level rules run.
5. Click **Save**.

## Post-Condition

- A new School Academic Alert record is created in **Draft** status.
- No Alert Level is set yet: it is only populated after the **Evaluate** button is used.
