# Reject School Incident

> **Module:** ssi*school_incident\
> **Model:** `school_incident`\
> **Menu:** School > Incident > Incidents\
> **Actor:** approver in group \_Officer (Counselor/Vice Principal)* or higher\
> **State:** `confirm` → `reject`\
> **Requires:** `04-confirm`

## Pre-Condition

- **Record:** Status is **Waiting for Approval**.
- **Access:** User is registered as an approver on the active approval template (belongs
  to the Officer (Counselor/Vice Principal) group or higher).
- **Access:** User has _Can Reject_ access right.

## Flow

### Single Record

1. Open the **School > Incident > Incidents** menu.
2. Open the School Incident record to reject.
3. Click the **Reject** button.
4. Click **OK** on the confirmation dialog.

### Bulk (Multiple Records)

1. Open the **School > Incident > Incidents** menu.
2. In the list view, open the **Filters** panel and select **Waiting for Approval** so
   only records awaiting approval are shown.
3. Select the checkbox of each record to reject — select only records where the active
   user is a valid approver, since a single ineligible record in the selection aborts
   the whole action and none of the selected records are rejected.
4. Click the **Reject** button that appears above the list.
5. Click **OK** on the confirmation dialog.

## Post-Condition

- Status changes to **Rejected**.
- When rejected in bulk, every selected record moves to **Rejected** in the same action.
