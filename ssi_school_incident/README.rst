School Incident
===============

Student incident and parent complaint handling, implementing the YPII
Incident & Parent Complaint Handling Guideline (v2.0):

* **Master Log incident tracking with SLA/escalation** -- log incident and
  parent complaint cases (School Incident) against configurable Incident
  Types, track first-contact and resolution SLAs per handling tier, keep a
  full parent contact history, and escalate a case to a higher handling
  tier against explicit, auditable Escalation Criteria.
* **Three-Color Academic Warning System** -- evaluate a student's academic
  standing (School Academic Alert) against configurable Academic Alert
  Levels (Yellow/Orange/Red), and create a linked School Incident once an
  Orange or Red alert is confirmed.
* **Weekly Case Review** -- a lightweight, checklist-driven Weekly Case
  Review that collects the period's School Incident cases and audits SLA
  breaches, unresolved cases, and escalation-criteria compliance.
