    Represents one run of the Three-Color Academic Warning System (Bab 8.3
    of the YPII Incident & Parent Complaint Handling Guideline v2.0): a
    check of a student's academic standing against the configurable
    ``school_academic_alert_level`` rules, so parents are warned early
    (Yellow/Orange/Red) instead of being surprised by a report card.

    The evaluation itself never hard-codes a grade-reading formula: it
    delegates to each ``school_academic_alert_level``'s ``python_code``
    (evaluated via ``mixin.localdict``'s safe-eval mechanism), optionally
    seeded with extra variables from this document's own
    ``evaluation_context``. Only Orange/Red outcomes are allowed to create
    a linked ``school_incident`` (via ``action_create_incident``). The
    approval workflow mirrors ``school_incident``'s: Draft -> Confirm ->
    Approve -> Open -> Done / Cancel.
